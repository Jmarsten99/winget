The main goal of this project is to create an intuitive GUI for the most common CLI package managers for Windows 10 and Windows 11, such as [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/), [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).  
With this app, you'll be able to easily download, install, update and uninstall any software that's published on the supported package managers — and so much more.

**This is WingetUI's official repository. If you are searching for WingetUI's homepage, please refer to [https://www.marticliment.com/wingetui/](https://www.marticliment.com/wingetui/)**

**Disclaimer:** This project has no connection with Winget, Chocolatey or Scoop — it's completely unofficial. Be aware of the fact that neither Microsoft, Chocolatey, Scoop nor the creators of WingetUI are responsible for the downloaded apps.

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: I am unable to install or upgrade a specific Winget package! What should I do?**<br>

A: This is likely an issue with Winget rather than WingetUI. 

Please check if it's possible to install/upgrade the package through PowerShell or the Command Prompt by using the commands `winget upgrade` or `winget install`, depending on the situation (for example: `winget upgrade --id Microsoft.PowerToys`). 

If this doesn't work, consider asking for help at [Winget's own project page](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).<br>

#

**Q: The name of a package is trimmed with ellipsis — how do I see its full name/id?**<br>

A: This is a known limitation of Winget. 

See more details in issue https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/2603.<br>

#

**Q: My antivirus is telling me that WingetUI is a virus! / My browser is blocking the download of WingetUI!**<br>

A: A common reason apps (i.e., executables) get blocked and/or detected as a virus — even when there's nothing malicious about them, like in the case of WingetUI — is because they're not being used by a relatively large amount of people.

Combine that with the fact that you might be downloading something that was recently released, and simply blocking unknown apps is in many cases a good precaution to take in order to prevent actual malware.

Since WingetUI is open source and safe to use, simply whitelist the app in the settings of your antivirus/browser.<br>

#

**Q: Can I add "msstore" as a source for Winget in the app?**<br>

A: This is not possible, nor is it planned for the near future. 

See more details in issue https://github.com/marticliment/WingetUI/issues/87.<br>

#

**Q: Are Winget/Scoop packages safe?**<br>

A: WingetUI, Microsoft and Scoop aren't responsible for the packages available for download, which are provided by third parties and can theoretically be compromised.

To mitigate the risks of downloading malware, Microsoft has implemented a few checks for the software available on Winget. Even so, It's recommended to only download software from publishers that you trust.

## Command-line parameters:
`--daemon`: Start WingetUI without spawnign a new window. WingetUI will run minimized on the system tray. WingetUI is called with this parameter when launched at startup.<br>
`--welcomewizard` (or simply `--welcome`): Show a window to choose which package managers to use.<br>
`--updateapps`: Enable automatic install of available updates.
